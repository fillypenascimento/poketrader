# poketrader
An app that allow fair pokemon trades between players. Pokemon info are gathered using the PokeApi v2 available at https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.

This app was built using NodeJS for the back-end API and ReactJS for the web application in order to provide an aesthetic user interface.
Data is persisted in a PostgreSQL database and was deployed to a Heroku server. Give it a look: [PokeTrader App](https://poketraderapp.herokuapp.com).
<!-- Data is persisted is a postgres database. -->

During the development of this project I tried to implement *SOLID principles* as most as possible considering both **my level of experience with those principles** and **that this is a small and simple application**.
